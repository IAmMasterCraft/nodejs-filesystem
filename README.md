# Node JS File System

- Create a script file that fetches data from JSON PLACEHOLDER POSTS
- Write the JSON data gotten from the API to a file called posts.json or posts.txt
- posts.json or post.txt should be in a directory file called result.
- Create a github repository and push your work.

## Installation

Make sure you have node js runtime environment up and running on your machine
```bash
node -v #to check node version
```
or head over to [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) the one for your preferred OS

## Usage
In the root directory of the project open the terminal and run:
```node
node index.js
```
You should get a response on the terminal to indicate that the api response has been written to file:
```bash
Response Data Written to posts.json file Successfully! #then you can check the result directory for the posts.json file
```
